# Plan 9 from Bell Labs
## UNIX:
### bad points

- network and GUI
- comparing about management model. If one issue appear, you need to update all and buy all new hardware. (Apple success to convince people to buy new deviceâ€¦â€¦)  Much easy for one system to maintain, not one unix for each different machine

## Plan 9 :
protocol - > 9P
everything is file:  even display, network

Not like UNIX  root directory, Plan 9 has execution environment
every execution environment has it own user space, (a little bit like hydra. content in particular name space)

Analogy -> your house, my house

#### UNION operate:
- unix
  - mount some file system  glue on others it together
- Plan 9
  - do not care what resource under this file. has union directory to one and glue all together

#### storage:
- plan 9 makes more file, the hardware company making more capacity. No worries here.
- backup system -> like time machine
